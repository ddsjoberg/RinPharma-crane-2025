## Description

{gtsummary} has become the most-used R package for clinical tables in the R ecosystem, winning awards from the American Statistical Association and Posit. Building on this foundation, we created {crane}, an open-source extension that facilitates reporting requirements in the pharmaceutical space. Because {crane} and {gtsummary} are built upon Analysis Results Datasets (ARDs), study teams can take advantage of this foundation that streamlines the QC process and allows for simple re-use of calculated results in subsequent reporting.

In this session we show how: (1) a vanilla {gtsummary} script instantly upgrades when {crane} is loaded; (2) ARD-based outputs make QC a straightforward operation; (3) LLMs can summarise the language-agnostic ARD results for medical writers in seconds. You’ll leave with a blueprint of how to adapt {crane} for your reporting needs or (or roll your own) and shorten table turnaround on day one.
